# Pneumonia Detection Application

This repository contains a deep learning-based project designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment via **Streamlit** for user-friendly interaction.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using TensorFlow and VGG16 architecture for image classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization and grayscale conversion of chest X-ray images.
- **Interactive Web Application**: A Streamlit-based app for uploading X-ray images and obtaining predictions.
- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is converted into TensorFlow Lite for efficient inference.

## Try the App

You can try the live version of this app here: [Pneumonia Detection App](#)  

*(Replace `#` with the actual link once the app is deployed.)*

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository-url>  
   cd pneumonia-detection  
   ```  

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS  
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows  
   ```  

3. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## How to Use

### Run Locally

1. **Start the Streamlit app**:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

2. **Interact with the app**:  
   - Upload a chest X-ray image to classify it as showing signs of pneumonia or normal.

### Use the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook notebooks/pneumonia_dl.ipynb  
   ```  

2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:  
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.  
   - Train the pneumonia detection model.  
   - Evaluate its performance and save the trained model.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Chest X-Ray Images Dataset** from Kaggle. The dataset contains labeled X-ray images for pneumonia and normal cases.

**Dataset Details**:  
- Training set: X-ray images labeled as normal or pneumonia.  
- Validation and test sets included for robust evaluation.  

**Source**: [Chest X-Ray Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

## Model Details

The deep learning model leverages the following techniques:  
- Pre-trained VGG16 network for feature extraction.  
- Custom dense layers added for pneumonia detection.  
- Data augmentation and normalization for improved generalization.  

The final models are saved in the `models/` folder as:  
- `model.keras`: The saved Keras model for training and evaluation.  
- `tflite_model.tflite`: The converted TensorFlow Lite model for deployment.
